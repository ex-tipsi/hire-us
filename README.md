# We're ready for new opportunities.

Our project is going to be closed but we are well-established team with great processes and we're ready to work on all together on new projects.

You might be interested if you're looking for a team to build a fully fledged product: web, mobile applications for all platforms, and backend.


Who we are:

* Fully remote team (6 frontend, 2 backend, 1 designer, 1 QA, 1 BA)
* We're doing React and React Native better than most teams
* We're not only doing React Native, but we have people with appropriate mobile backgrounds
* We have fully automated CI/CD pipelines
* We know how to write e2e (ent-to-end) tests that will run on all platforms (web, ios, android)
* We know how to do backend things with python and have 10+ years experience in it
* We're doing monitoring. We have distributed tracing for microservices
* You can see our open-sourced code here: https://github.com/tipsi


What are your benefits:

* You're not going to spend a lot of time and money to get on the rails. We've built the team, and we know how much it costs.
* You still can hire desired person directly (for example via LinkedIn profile)


What do we want:

* Ideally we want to survive as a team. Distributed and remote
* We're ready to join other companies that might be interested in it
* We can work as contractors
* If you're interested in some particular member - feel free to contact them directly. Everyone has no obligations and is available for hiring.



Our stack:

* Web: reactjs, react-router, react-redux
* Mobile: react native, but we can to native apps too
* Backend: python, django, django-rest-framework, asyncio, sanic, postgresql/mysql
* Infrastructure: AWS, docker containers, ansible, prometheus, ELK, zipkin

You may question why we have so many `Team Leads` here, that's because we all know how a good team should be built and what is important to organize work.

### Language situation

We intentionally built a team with all Russian speakers to eliminate communication barriers.

But most of the team has daily experience in writing and verbal communications in English. All our documents are in English, code comments, apparently, too.


# About processes

## What you can expect from us

We have a full development cycle, only business requirements and acceptance criteria are required from you.

1. You have some business requirement
2. Our BA will start gathering requirements and assemble everything in the document
3. A designer will prepare and provide all visual artifacts
4. You will approve document/media if you want
5. Backend team will develop and fill all API endpoints into the document
6. Frontend team will add required components and connect it to the backend
7. QA will test and prepare release version
8. Changes will be deployed to test and then production environments

After that we run retrospective and make changes in processes if required.

When we decide to change something, we can implement changes. Read more about it below.

## Automation

We love to automate things. Especially management and communications routine!

We're quite good at tracking time. Most of our team worked via upwork and we have a custom project to collect everything together via jira/gitlab/upwork APIs. So you can get details for each task, each member time report or daily team report. Everything you might need to understand current state.

Also we have a review cycle that is fully automated and bot-driven, so there is no lag in code review.


# Our project setup

We used to develop and support 7 applications for IOS and Android, admin site and backend with **weekly** sprints and releases. We're able to do this only because of processes and testing everything.

## Mobile apps / React Native

Links may die in future but still alive:

[Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calvert-woodley/id1325616215)

[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tipsi.cw)


Think about it: 7 apps * 2 platforms * 2 active OS versions = 28 fully working applications were tested and delivered every week.

React Native (RN) isn't particularly mature or stable library and we couldn't afford hordes of QA specialists. So we did all kind of automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) to make sure that everything is ok.

All this was built on top of amazing GitlabCI with on-commit and scheduled builds. And uploading to Appstore was just a CI job.


## Web

Everything that you might expect from modern React stack: React, react-router, react-redux, normalizr and etc.


Unit, integration and e2e (selenium) tests.

### Notable on frontend

[tipsi-stripe](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-stripe) We always were sure that good React Native project should support both mobile platforms at the same time. We always were sure that payment processing library should be well-tested. There was no such project to fulfill our requirements with Stripe + RN. We've made it. 
Tip: braintree has no such library right now so you can create it and earn fame.

[Eslint plugin](https://github.com/tipsi/eslint-plugin-tipsi) - don't waste time on recurrent reviewer comments, use linter.

[React/RN router](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-router) - share your code not only between mobile platforms but web as well.

[Flavors](https://github.com/tipsi/babel-plugin-tipsi-flavors) - don't limit yourself only to `.ios.js`/`.android.js` suffixes, create your own flavors. We needed a lot of different customizations for different clients and to have simple and clean codebase. Flavors give us ability to reuse our code in simple and powerful ways, easily enable and disable features during build without any code changes.

[TravisCI for mobile platforms](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-travis-scripts) - let your team write build scripts in familiar language. Make you life easier with free TravisCI e2e tests on mobile platforms.

[Appium helper](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-appium-helper) - when you need to customize your mobile e2e scenarios in some easy and reproducible way.


## Backend

We work in kanban here. Because kanban is excellent for tiny teams (2 ppl in our case). It is easy to manage priorities, no hustle about sprint's ends/planning, you always know where you have a bottleneck.

We deployed a project on AWS in docker containers with docker-compose.

We are in the absolute love-love relationship with pytest and did all testing for the backend with it.

We had all kind of tests here: unit, integration, e2e, and, obviously, CI for everything. And because of testing, we had several fearless migrations (without breaking production):

* bare metal => docker
* mysql => postgresql
* python2 => python3
* and we always had the most recent django and python versions!

All services were either django/drf or asyncio/sanic.

### Notable on backend
We have [homegrown solution](https://github.com/Nepherhotep/django-rest-framework-dyn-serializer) to make lazy API's with django-rest-framework. We're aware of GraphQL and want to move in this direction.


[Fan](https://github.com/tipsi/fan) - because we want microservices with swappable protocols, full tracing support, full versioning support and no solutions can give us it now. Additionaly you can easily connect any existing API without modification by having near an additional service and yaml config.


[pytest](https://github.com/tipsi/pytest-tipsi-testing) and [pytest + django](https://github.com/tipsi/pytest-tipsi-django) - if you want to have full control on what fixtures you have during tests or you want to have transactions support for django not only in function scope.

[aiozk](https://github.com/tipsi/aiozk) - there were no asyncio+zookeeper bindings, we've changed this.

[tipsi_tools](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi_tools) - ours toolbelt. Check it; You might always want to have `tipsi_tools.python.rel_path` or `tipsi_tools.drf.use_form
` functions!



## Infrastructure

Everything was deployed on AWS. Nothing special here: ec2, rds (postgresql), s3. Host setup with ansible.

Some compute intensive things were hosted on hetzner: ELK stack, OSX VM's, Android emulators. We were able to keep our bills sane due to this segregation.

We know how to run e2e tests on OSX in KVM. It gives us the ability to run tests for Android and IOS on the same machine.

GitlabCI was our main CI server. But we have experience with TravisCI for public repos (including mobile e2e tests). And almost every task that can be automated was automated: running test, running integration tests, building documentation, automated deployments. For example if you need a single page application, you will get not only designs and page itself but the full pipeline: commit -> docker container -> tests -> deployment to production.
