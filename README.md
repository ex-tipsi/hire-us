# Team is ready for new opportunities.

We're an experienced and process-driven development team currently accepting applications for new projects.

Our team is an excellent fit for businesses aimed at building fully fledged products including: web, multi-platform mobile applications, and back-end coding.


Who we are:

* Fully remote team (6 frontend, 2 backend, 1 designer, 1 QA, 1 BA)
* We do React and React Native better than most teams
* We don't only do React Native, but we also have people with appropriate mobile backgrounds
* We have fully automated CI/CD pipelines
* We know how to write e2e (ent-to-end) tests that will run on all platforms (web, ios, android)
* We know how to do backend things with python and have 10+ years experience in it
* We do monitoring. We have distributed tracing for microservices
* You can see our open-sourced code [here](https://github.com/tipsi)


What are your benefits:

* You're not going to spend a lot of time and money to get on the rails. We've built the team, and we know how much it costs.
* You still can hire a desired person directly (for example, via a LinkedIn profile)


What do we want:

* Ideally we want to survive as a team. Distributed and remote
* We're ready to join other companies that might be interested in it
* We can work as contractors
* If you're interested in some particular member - feel free to contact them directly. Everyone has no obligations and is available for hiring.



Our stack:

* Web: reactjs, react-router, react-redux
* Mobile: react native, but we can do native apps, too
* Backend: python, django, django-rest-framework, asyncio, sanic, postgresql/mysql
* Infrastructure: AWS, docker containers, ansible, prometheus, ELK, zipkin

You may question why we have so many `Team Leads` here, that's because we all know how a good team should be built and what is important to organize work.

### Language situation

We have intentionally built a team with all Russian speakers to eliminate communication barriers.

But most of the team has daily experience in writing and verbal communications in English. All our documents are in English, code comments are, apparently, too.


# About processes

## What you can expect from us

We have a full development cycle, only business requirements and acceptance criteria are required from you.

1. You have some business requirements
2. Our BA will start gathering requirements and assemble everything into a specification
3. The designer will prepare and provide all visual artifacts
4. You will approve the specification/media if you want
5. The backend team will develop and fill all the API endpoints in the specification
6. The frontend team will add the required components and connect them to the backend
7. The QA will test and prepare a release version
8. Changes will be deployed to the test and then production environments

After that, we run the retrospective and make changes in the processes if required.

When we decide to change something, we can implement changes. Read more about it below.

## Automation

We love to automate things. Especially management and communications routine!

We're quite good at tracking time. Most of our team have worked via upwork and we have a custom project to collect everything together via jira/gitlab/upwork APIs. So you can get details for each task, each member time report or a daily team report. Everything you might need to understand the current state of the things.

Also we have a review cycle that is fully automated and bot-driven, so there is no lag in code review.


# Our project setup

We used to develop and support 7 applications for IOS and Android, admin site and backend with **weekly** sprints and releases. We're able to do this only because of our processes and testing everything.

## Mobile apps / React Native

Links may die in future but are still alive:

[Appstore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calvert-woodley/id1325616215)

[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tipsi.cw)


Think about it: 7 apps * 2 platforms * 2 active OS versions = 28 fully working applications were tested and delivered every week.

React Native (RN) isn't a particularly mature or stable library and we couldn't afford hordes of QA specialists. So we did all kinds of automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) to make sure that everything is ok.

All this was built on top of amazing GitlabCI with on-commit and scheduled builds. And uploading to Appstore was just a CI job.


## Web

Everything that you might expect from modern React stack: React, react-router, react-redux, normalizr and etc.


Unit, integration and e2e (selenium) tests.

### Notable on frontend

[tipsi-stripe](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-stripe) We were always sure that a good React Native project should support both mobile platforms at the same time. We were always sure that a payment processing library should be well-tested. There was no such project to fulfill our requirements with Stripe + RN. We've made it.

Tip: braintree has no such library right now so you can create it and earn fame.

[Eslint plugin](https://github.com/tipsi/eslint-plugin-tipsi) - don't waste time on recurrent reviewer comments, use linter.

[React/RN router](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-router) - share your code not only between mobile platforms but web as well.

[Flavors](https://github.com/tipsi/babel-plugin-tipsi-flavors) - don't limit yourself only to `.ios.js`/`.android.js` suffixes, create your own flavors. We needed a lot of different customizations for different clients and a simple and clean codebase. Flavors give us the ability to reuse our code in simple and powerful ways, to easily enable and disable features during the build phase without any code changes.

[TravisCI for mobile platforms](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-travis-scripts) - let your team write build scripts in a familiar language. Make you life easier with free TravisCI e2e tests on mobile platforms.

[Appium helper](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi-appium-helper) - when you need to customize your mobile e2e scenarios in an easy and reproducible way.


## Backend

We work in Kanban here because Kanban is excellent for tiny teams (2 ppl in our case). It is easy to manage priorities, no hustle about sprint's ends/planning, you always know where you have a bottleneck.

We deployed projects on AWS in docker containers with docker-compose.

We are in the absolute love-love relationship with pytest and did all testing for the backend with it.

We have had all kinds of tests here: unit, integration, e2e, and, obviously, CI for everything. And because of testing, we had several fearless migrations (without breaking production):

* bare metal => docker
* mysql => postgresql
* python2 => python3
* and we have always had the most recent django and python versions!

All our services were either django/drf or asyncio/sanic.

### Notable on backend
We have [homegrown solution](https://github.com/Nepherhotep/django-rest-framework-dyn-serializer) to make lazy API's with django-rest-framework. We're aware of GraphQL and want to move in this direction.


[Fan](https://github.com/tipsi/fan) - because we want microservices with swappable protocols, full tracing support, full versioning support and there are no solutions that can give it to us now. Additionaly, you can easily connect to any existing API without modification by having near an additional service and yaml config.


[pytest](https://github.com/tipsi/pytest-tipsi-testing) and [pytest + django](https://github.com/tipsi/pytest-tipsi-django) - if you want to have full control on what fixtures you have during the tests or you want to have transaction support for django not only in function scope.

[aiozk](https://github.com/tipsi/aiozk) - there were no asyncio+zookeeper bindings, we've changed this.

[tipsi_tools](https://github.com/tipsi/tipsi_tools) - our toolbelt. Check it; You might have always wanted to have `tipsi_tools.python.rel_path` or `tipsi_tools.drf.use_form
` functions!



## Infrastructure

Everything was deployed on AWS. Nothing special here: ec2, rds (postgresql), s3. Host setup with Ansible.

Some compute intensive things were hosted on Hetzner: ELK stack, OSX VM's, Android emulators. We were able to keep our bills sane due to this segregation.

We know how to run e2e tests on OSX in KVM. It gives us the ability to run tests for Android and IOS on the same machine.

GitlabCI was our main CI server. But we have experience with TravisCI for public repos (including mobile e2e tests). And almost every task that can be automated was automated: running test, running integration tests, building documentation, automated deployments. For example if you need a single page application, you will get not only designs and page itself but the full pipeline: commit -> docker container -> tests -> deployment to production.
